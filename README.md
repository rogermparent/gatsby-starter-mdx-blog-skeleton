# Gatsby Starter: MDX Blog Skeleton

Do you want to run `@arrempee/gatsby-theme-mdx-blog`, but find the documentation
either too long, or too lacking?

First off, I'm sorry. Second, you've come to the right starter!

This is a quick change of the default Gatsby starter that shows off all the
features of an *unconfigured* instance of `@arrempee/gatsby-theme-mdx-blog`. There's
templated MDX page creation (with templates defined in the frontmatter), tags
and categories with index pages, and oodles of nodes for all your customization needs!

## Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new my-awesome-blog https://github.com/rogermparent/gatsby-starter-mdx-blog-skeleton.git
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-awesome-blog/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-awesome-blog` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `content/index.mdx`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## Where to start?

1. **`/content`**: This directory contains the MDX files that will be turned
   into pages.

2. **`/src/templates`**: This directory contains all the templates that MDX
   pages will be rendered from.
